This is a French bakery data analysis project.

The notebook contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and suggestions on improving the business indicators based on an existing dataset.
Also, you can find <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/code/timakh/french-bakery-sales-analysis'>this notebook</a> on Kaggle.
<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matthieugimbert/french-bakery-daily-sales'>The dataset</a> was also taken from Kaggle.
I have built Yandex Datalens and Superset dashboards using preprocessed data. 
You can find the Superset dashboard files in the repository. 
Datalens dashboard (on Russian) is available by the following link: https://datalens.yandex.ru/gpkdeq52t0qi5-prodazhi-francuzskoy-pekarni
